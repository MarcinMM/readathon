Dear <%= @name %>,

I am excited to participate in the Richmond PTA’s Read for Richmond this year, and I need your help! You can support literacy and help support Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) enrichment activities (and other PTA initiatives) at Richmond by pledging my participation in Read for Richmond today! Please visit Read4Richmond.com for examples of how pledge money will be used.

I have made a commitment to read every day. I will keep track of the minutes I read, and you can visit my profile page any time to see how I’m doing <%= current_student.bitly_profile %>.
You can pledge me using this link <%= current_student.bitly_pledge %>.
You can also mail a check to Richmond School PTA, 2276 SE 41 ST Ave., Portland OR, 97214. Just be sure to put my name and “Read for Richmond” in the memo line!

Thank you for encouraging me to read, and for supporting literacy and STEAM at Richmond!

Sincerely,
<%= @student.first %> <%= @student.last %>
