          Read for Richmond is a fun way to encourage students to build their academic
          skills by reading every day. This year, Read for Richmond is also a Richmond PTA
          fundraiser that will raise money for enhanced Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math
          (STEAM) experiential learning opportunities at Richmond, or other PTA initiatives.

          The Richmond PTA is proud to be a part of this exciting project that supports
          STEAM enrichment at school AND encourages our amazing young readers. Please
          support our students by making a pledge to Read for Richmond and sharing your
          student’s page with friends and family. Our fundraising goal this year is approximately
          $40 per student. If you are unable to donate, your child can still
          participate by tracking their reading and working toward their class reading goal!
