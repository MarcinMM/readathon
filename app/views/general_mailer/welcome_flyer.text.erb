Support the Richmond Read-A-Thon!

The Richmond Read-A-Thon is an exciting way to encourage students to read each day. The Read-A-Thon is also a fundraiser for the Richmond School Foundation (RSF), supporting the school's budget for teachers and staff. The Read-A-Thon raises funds through pledges, and the more our kids read, the more support the school receives!
